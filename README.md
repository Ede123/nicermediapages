Nicer Media Pages
=================

Nicer Media Pages changes Firefox's default design for media pages (images and videos) so they look better, appear more modern and are even more functional.

This includes:
* Remove the annoying noisy grainy darkish background from media pages and use a consistent homogeneous shade of gray instead.
* Remove the annoying noisy grainy light-grayish background of transparent images and use a pure white instead.
* On hovering, show transparency in images by displaying a checkerboard style background.
